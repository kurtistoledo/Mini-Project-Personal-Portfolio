            <p>Hello! My name is Kurtis Toledo, and I am a 37-year-old aspiring software engineer with a passion for technology and continuous learning. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Chicago State University.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am on my second internship at United Airlines, where I work in the Platform Engineering/DevOps team. This role has allowed me to deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure, automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.</p>
            <p>My journey into the tech world has been fueled by curiosity and a desire to solve complex problems. During my time at Chicago State University, I developed a solid foundation in various programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies. My coursework and projects have equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in the fast-paced and ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
            <p>Outside of work and academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me hiking, reading, or spending quality time with my family and friends.</p>
            <p>I am excited to continue my career in software development and look forward to making meaningful contributions to the tech community. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy learning more about my journey and the projects I have worked on.</p>
